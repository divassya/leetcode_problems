+------------+--------------+--------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 | 
+------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation: Bob and George both have a condition that starts with DIAB1.

The expression conditions REGEXP '\\bDIAB1' is actually the same as conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%' OR conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%';, but it is obviously shorter. ðŸ˜‰

The reason they are the same is that \b matches either a non-word character (in our case, a space) or the position before the first character in the string. Also, you need to escape a backslash with another backslash, like so: \\b. Otherwise, the regular expression won't evaluate.

P.S. \b also matches the position after the last character, but it doesn't matter in the context of this problem.

# MySQL query statement below
select * from Patients where conditions REGEXP '\\bDIAB1'
